Memory mapping:
	-MemoryMappedFile should be replaced by java.nio.MappedByteBuffer as this does proper memory mapping (cross-process & outside the Java heap)
	-Would loacing a MappedByteBuffer of the files requiring mapping mean the TabixReader cute/paste is not required?

TabixReader: reads entire index into memory at start: is the standard loading function too slow?
picard tools 1.77 is really old: might want to update as latest version has improved SAM/BAM streaming as well as TabixRead improvements

RealignmentCluster: really doing an O(n^2) pair-wise clustering between all possible genomic interval?

0 test cases! Where are all the unit tests?

direct access to field for objects that should encapsulate them

direct setting of (what should be read-only) fields instead of constructor args or builder pattern

hardcoded unconfigurable bounds

magic numbers in code: eg: RealignmentCluster lower/upper bounds

RealignmentCluster.matchConsensus not implemented

no meaningful javadocs

shouldn't mapqAvg be mapqsum? why does the addition of a read with mapq=0 make a good cluster worse?

many giant functions & classes with many subclasses - they should be split up

O(n^2) cluster matching used: within O(n^2) pair-wise interval matching = O(n^4) implementation - O(nlogn) is possible by using interval trees or a traditional clustering algorithm

net.wehi is not the correct namespace. Should use au.edu.wehi
