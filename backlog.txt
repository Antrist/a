Working on: Somatic evidence tracking, More metrics!

Issue: SCs split up well-behaved assembly microhomologies as well

Move ACONS into BREAKPOINT_ID_KEY and separate fa (or fq - need to do at assembly time to retain full assembly base quals)
Sequential naming of variants

Modelling:
SV vs Reference hypothesis testing

Need independence of evidence: P(H|E_1)*P(H|E_2) = P(H|{E_1,E_2})
	or do I want P(H/null|E_1)*P(H/null|E_2) = P(H/null|{E_1,E_2})
		second option is better as I can just sum logs
	we want it to be independent of priors as well! I think it might be
