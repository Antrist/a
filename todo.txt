SAM Tags before split read id
Add FixMateInformation into ComputeSamTags (including populating MC tag)
	- try to search for correct mate based on mate mapping location
		(then self alignment position since the unmapped is usually stored with it's mate) 

Filters:
- dovetailing (SC & RP)
- coverage blacklist (SAMEvidenceSource.getBlacklistedRegions)
- entropy
- mapq (including split reads)
- vendor QC
- adapter (trim adapter?)
- SC length
- indel length


- Incorporate FixMateInformation into ComputeSamTags


TODO:
get SAMEvidenceSource to iterate over subset/subset+SR if these exist (tag metrics; flags metrics
Add SAMProgramRecord headers to all programs
Readd Assembly visualisation hooks
How to handle conscripted evidence? We don't know if it's conscripted until we realign the breakend assembly
How well are assemblies displayed in IGV? 
Better dovetail handling

.lang -> .lang3
Ordering -> Comparator

Unanchored assemblies:
	add custom Sam Tag to flag as inexact
	Update SingleReadEvidence, IndelEvidence (ignore alignment), and SplitReadEvidence to handle breakend margin
	How does IGV display CIGAR Ns at the end of a read? Do we need the Xs?
	Idea: Cigar of 10N100S -> minimal extra logic + clearly soft clipped
