TODO:
Add SAMProgramRecord headers to all programs
Readd Assembly visualisation hooks
How to handle conscripted evidence? We don't know if it's conscripted until we realign the breakend assembly
How well are assemblies displayed in IGV? 

Unanchored assemblies:
	add custom Sam Tag to flag as inexact
	Update SingleReadEvidence, IndelEvidence (ignore alignment), and SplitReadEvidence to handle breakend margin
	How does IGV display CIGAR Ns at the end of a read? Do we need the Xs?
	Idea: Cigar of 10N100S -> minimal extra logic + clearly soft clipped
